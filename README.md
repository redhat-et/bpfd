# ![bpfd](./docs/img/bpfd.svg)

A system daemon for managing eBPF programs.
## Why bpfd?

bpfd seeks to solve the following problems:

- To allow multiple XDP programs to share the same interface
- To give administrators control over who can load programs and to allow them to define rules for ordering of networking eBPF programs
- To allow programs to be loaded automatically at system launch time
- To simplify the packaging and loading of eBPF-based infrastructure software (i.e Kubernetes CNI plugins)

## How does it work?

bpfd is built using [Aya](https://aya-rs.dev) an eBPF library written in Rust.
It offers two ways of interaction:

- `bpfctl`: a command line tool
- using GRPC

It is expected that humans will use `bpfctl` whereas other applications on the system wishing to load programs using
bpfd will use the GRPC. This allows for API bindings to be generated in any language supported by protocol buffers.
We are initially targeting Go and Rust.
See [tutorial.md](docs/admin/tutorial.md) for some examples using `bpfctl`.

In order to allow the attachment of multiple XDP programs to the same interface, we have implemented the
[libxdp multiprog protocol](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools/blob/master/lib/libxdp/protocol.org).
Offering this in bpfd allows for XDP applications whose loader was not using libxdp to benefit from this.
We are also hoping to find a way for applications linked with libxdp to use bpfd instead if it's
in use in the system.

## Development Environment Setup

- [Rust Stable & Rust Nightly](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
rustup toolchain install nightly -c rustfmt,clippy,rust-src
```
- LLVM 11 or later (Linux package managers should provide a recent enough release)

```shell
sudo dnf install llvm-devel clang-devel
```

- [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker)

```shell
cargo install bpf-linker
```

- [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

```shell
sudo dnf install protobuf-compiler
```

- A checkout of libbpf

```shell
git clone https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf --branch v0.8.0
```

## Building bpfd

```
$ cargo xtask build-ebpf --libbpf-dir /path/to/libbpf
$ cargo build
```

## Usage

Run the following script to generate certs in the default directory `/etc/bpfd/certs/` (see [configuration.md](docs/admin/configuration.md) for using non-default values, or add files to remove the `No config file provided.` warnings):

```shell
sudo ./scripts/certificates.sh init
```

Load a sample XDP Program:
```
$ cargo build
$ sudo ./target/debug/bpfd&
$ sudo ./target/debug/bpfctl load /path/to/xdp/program -p xdp -i wlp2s0 --priority 50 -s "pass"
```
